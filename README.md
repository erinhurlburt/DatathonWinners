## Task
Help small, women-owned, and minority-owned businesses secure Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) contract awards. Using descriptive and diagnostic analytics, analyze patterns in the potential total value of awards granted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

## Data Archive
Award Data Archive for the EPA can be found [here](https://www.usaspending.gov/download_center/award_data_archive)

## Actionable Insights
The number of contracts for small, women-owned, and minority-owned businesses has decreased significantly since 2020. Among these disadvantaged businesses, there is a disproportional allocation of contracts and dollar amounts being distributed.

## Our Solution
Find a relationship between number of disadvantaged business types and the number of contracts being given to each sub-category of these disadvantaged businesses (small, women-owned, and minority-owned businesses). Use this relationship to create a proportional ratio of number of businesses to number of contracts to allow fair distribution of contracts among disadvantaged businesses.
